    <h1>Hey fellow disgruntled trainers!</h1>
    <p> My name's Shane Brunswick, and I'm 14 years old. I set out to make this game in hopes of alerting Niantic of the severity of the communities disdain for current spawning mechanics.</p>
    <p>C'mon, Niantic, I've literally managed to teach myself Javascript just to make a statement regarding the lack of Pokemon in suburban/rural areas in Pokemon GO! (granted, if my game were a Pidgey, by comparison, yours would be a Dragonite, so full
      marks for... most of what you've done with GO)</p>
    <p>If you'd like to help me in my plight, share this game on your Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or all three! (if you're one of the two people left on earth who still use Google+) Here's a convenient link if you want to do that now.</p>

    <p>If you would like to contact me, my email is suburbanversion@gmail.com. Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "for the love of Arceus, just let me play the game" (alternatively: Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "that felt like a forced transition")! Just click
      the button below!</p>
