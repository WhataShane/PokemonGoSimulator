### Pokemon: Suburban Version. http://suburbanversion.com/game

My name's Shane Brunswick, and I'm 14 years old. I set out to make this game in hopes of alerting Niantic of the severity of the communities disdain for current spawning mechanics.

C'mon, Niantic, I've literally managed to teach myself Javascript just to make a statement regarding the lack of Pokemon in suburban/rural areas in Pokemon GO! (granted, if my game were a Pidgey, by comparison, yours would be a Dragonite, so full marks for... most of what you've done with GO)

---

My games been featured in a multitude of international media outlets! Thank you, everyone, for helping me spread the message! Niantic, if you're reading this, please level the playing field for suburban/rural Pokemon GO players! As you can see below, the lack of viable Pokemon in non-metropolitan areas is afflicting Pokemon GO players internationally.
